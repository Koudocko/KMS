KMS is a organization tool used to log Japanese Kanji/Vocab which will hopefully make me not want to *kill myself* throughout this language learning experience.

## Initial Plan

  - On'yomi 
  - Kun'yomi 
  - Description 
- Create Vocab entries
  - Reading
  - Description
  - Type
- Auto link connected Kanji and Vocab 

## Future

- Spaced repetition system
- Server-side and profiles
