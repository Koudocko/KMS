KMS is a organization tool used to log Japanese Kanji/Vocab which will hopefully make me not want to *kill myself* throughout this language learning experience.

## Initial Plan
- Create Kanji entries 
  - With meaning
  - With on'yomi 
  - With kun'yomi 
  - With description 
- Create Vocab entries
  - With meaning
  - With reading
  - With description
  - With exception flag
  - With type
- Auto link connected Kanji and Vocab 
- Search function for Kanji and Vocab 
- Create groups for Kanji and Vocab
  - With group name
  - With group image
  - Add/Remove from group
- Expand and minimize groups
- Vocab filter
  - By type
  - By grouping
  - By exception flag

## Future Plan (may or may not)
- Kanji and Vocab audio file support
- Spaced repetition system
- Server-side and profiles
